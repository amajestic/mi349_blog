            </figure>
            <p><i>Dark Rise</i> is the first book in a new fantasy series by C.S. Pacat. Set in 1820s London, 16-year-old Will Kempen has been on the run from his mother's killers for months. 
            When his past finally catches up to him, he discovers a magical world on the brink of destruction from an ancient evil known as the Dark King. 
            With an order of knights known as the Stewards and a young Indian woman with super-strength, it's up to Will and his ragtag team to prevent the Dark King from ascending to power.
            </p>
            <h4 class="quote">“I think what people were is less important than what they are. 
            And what people are is less important than what they could be.”
            </h4>
            <p>Where Dark Rise thrives is through Pacat's interpretation of tried and true fantasy trope, such as the Chosen One and the fight between Light and Dark. 
            Will is, by all means, a Chosen One. While in other fantasy novels, that might mean that Will's destiny is cut and dry, Pacat explores that your destiny isn't predetermined; 
            there are no absolutes, and you can make your own path.
            </p>
            <p>With rich worldbuilding, captivating battles, and surprising twists and turns, <i>Dark Rise</i> is a great book for lovers of all things fantasy.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Zoe Hana Mikuta's debut novel <i>Gearbreakers</i> is a dystopian queer romance with some giant robots sprinkled in.</p>
            <p>Sona Steelcrest is the Pilot of a Windup &mdash; a giant mecha with the purpose of destruction and killing. 
            To control the Windup, she becomes cybernetically enhanced so she can directly plug into the machine. 
            She carries out the orders of Godolia, the tyrannical empire hell-bent on more power. 
            But Sona has a secret; she intentionally became a Windup so she could take Godolia down from the inside. 
            </p>
            <p>Eris Shindanai is a Gearbreaker, a rebel who hates Godolia and everything it stand for. 
            She and her team of other Gearbreakers specialize in hijacking and taking down Windups. 
            But when a mission goes wrong, Eris is captured, and Godolia plans to corrupt her mind and send her back to the other Gearbreakers as a traitor.
            </p>
            <p>Sona sees Eris as her chance to fulfill her plan, and they plan a jailbreak. 
            With a common goal, Sona and Eris could finally put an end to Godolia's reign &mdash; but first, they have to learn to trust each other.
            </p>
            <h4 class="quote">“'And…try to not think worse of me.' In my pocket, my forefinger curls into the crook of my thumb. There is so much heat in my face that it is a tangible weight. 'Worse than you already do.'”</h4>
            <p>Filled with beautiful prose and heart-stopping action, Mikuta crafts a wonderful sci-fi novel. But perhaps the highlight of the book is the growing romance between Sona and Eris. 
            Initially, both are unsure if they can trust the other. But through their shared hatred of Godolia, they learn that love is possible even in a world divided by violence.
